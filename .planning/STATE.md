## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack recommendation from research: Expo + Fastify + PostgreSQL + Redis + BullMQ + Socket.IO + RevenueCat
- Monorepo approach (Turborepo) for shared TypeScript types between mobile app and API
- bcrypt for password hashing (10 rounds) over argon2 for React Native compatibility
- Refresh token rotation: old token revoked on use, new pair issued
- Service layer pattern: routes validate input (zod), call service, return response
- CommonJS module output for API to ensure Node.js compatibility with all deps
- Dark theme with Pokemon-inspired gold accent (#f0c040) for branded immersive feel
- Web-compatible SecureStore wrapper using localStorage fallback for development
- Emoji-based avatar presets representing 16 Pokemon types for cross-platform compatibility
- isAdmin boolean flag on users table for admin role (simple approach)
- Card IDs generated as {setId}-{localId} composite pattern
- TCGdex API as card data source with rarity mapping to diamond/star/crown enum
- Batch card inserts in groups of 50 within per-set transactions
- 409 Conflict response for duplicate set import attempts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- App Store/Google Play IAP policies need verification (impacts Phase 6)
- Trade matching algorithm design needs deeper research (impacts Phase 4)
